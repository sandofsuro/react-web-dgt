* Animations are an important part of modern UX, and the `Animated`\n\t * library is designed to make them fluid, powerful, and easy to build and\n\t * maintain.\n\t *\n\t * The simplest workflow is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or\n\t * more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates either\n\t * via animations, such as `Animated.timing`, or by hooking into gestures like\n\t * panning or scrolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n\t * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n\t * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n\t *\n\t *```javascript\n\t *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n\t *    constructor(props) {\n\t *      super(props);\n\t *      this.state = {\n\t *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n\t *      };\n\t *    }\n\t *    componentDidMount() {\n\t *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n\t *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n\t *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n\t *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n\t *    }\n\t *    render() {\n\t *      return (\n\t *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n\t *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n\t *          {this.props.children}\n\t *        </Animated.View>\n\t *      );\n\t *    }\n\t *  }\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n\t * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n\t * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n\t * the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to\n\t * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n\t * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n\t *\n\t * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n\t * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n\t * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n\t *\n\t * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n\t * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n\t * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n\t * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n\t * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n\t *\n\t * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n\t * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n\t * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n\t *\n\t *```javascript\n\t *  style={{\n\t *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n\t *    transform: [{\n\t *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n\t *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n\t *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n\t *      }),\n\t *    }],\n\t *  }}>\n\t *```\n\t *\n\t * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n\t * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n\t * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n\t *\n\t * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n\t * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n\t * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n\t *\n\t * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n\t * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](docs/animations.html).\n\t *\n\t * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n\t * can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n\t * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n\t * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n\t * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n\t * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n\t * implications in the future.\n\t */\n\tmodule.exports={\n\t/**\n\t   * Standard value class for driving animations.

The reasoning is that a\n\t *   platform scroll view that isn't built on top of the responder system has\n\t *   began scrolling, and the active responder must now be notified that the\n\t *   interaction is no longer locked to it - the system has taken over.\n\t *\n\t * - Responder being released:\n\t *   As soon as no more touches that *started* inside of descendants of the\n\t *   *current* responderInst, an `onResponderRelease` event is dispatched to the\n\t *   current responder, and the responder lock is released.\n\t *\n\t * TODO:\n\t * - on \"end\", a callback hook for `onResponderEndShouldRemainResponder` that\n\t *   determines if the responder lock should remain.\n\t * - If a view shouldn't \"remain\" the responder, any active touches should by\n\t *   default be considered \"dead\" and do not influence future negotiations or\n\t *   bubble paths. It should be as if those touches do not exist.\n\t * -- For multitouch: Usually a translate-z will choose to \"remain\" responder\n\t *  after one out of many touches ended. For translate-y, usually the view\n\t *  doesn't wish to \"remain\" responder after one of many touches end.\n\t * - Consider building this on top of a `stopPropagation` model similar to\n\t *   `W3C` events.\n\t * - Ensure that `onResponderTerminate` is called on touch cancels, whether or\n\t *   not `onResponderTerminationRequest` returns `true` or `false`.\n\t *\n\t */\n\t\n\t/*

about event ordering in the `EventPluginHub`.\n\t *\n\t * Suppose plugins are injected in the following order:\n\t *\n\t * `[R, S, C]`\n\t *\n\t * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n\t * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n\t *\n\t * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n\t *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n\t *   `extractEvents()`.\n\t * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n\t *   dispatched events\".\n\t * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n\t *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n\t * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n\t *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n\t *   name deferred).\n\t *\n\t * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n\t * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n\t * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n\t * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n\t * in the first place.\n\t *\n\t * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n\t *\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n\t * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n\t *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n\t * - They should not have side effects.\n\t * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n\t *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n\t *   extraction.\n\t *\n\t * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n\t *\n\t * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n\t * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n\t * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n\t * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n\t *\n\t * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n\t * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n\t * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n\t * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n\t * will appear as follows:\n\t *\n\t * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n\t * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n\t */\n\t\n\tfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n\t  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === 'topSelectionChange' ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\t\n\t  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n\t  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\t\n\t  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n\t  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n\t   *\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n\t   *\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n\t   *\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n\t   *\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n\t   *\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n\t   *\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n\t   *\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n\t   *     }\n\t   *\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n\t   *\n\t   */\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n\t        return true;\n\t      }\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n\t        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t    return false;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n\t    if (a === b) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (\n\t      !isIterable(b) ||\n\t      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n\t      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n\t      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n\t      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n\t      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n\t    ) {\n\t      return false;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n\t      return true;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\t\n\t    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n\t      var entries = a.entries();\n\t      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n\t        var entry = entries.next().value;\n\t        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n\t      }) && entries.next().done;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var flipped = false;\n\t\n\t    if (a.size === undefined) {\n\t      if (b.size === undefined) {\n\t        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n\t          a.cacheResult();\n\t        }\n\t      } else {\n\t        flipped = true;\n\t        var _ = a;\n\t        a = b;\n\t        b = _;\n\t      }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var allEqual = true;\n\t    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n\t      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n\t          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n\t        allEqual = false;\n\t        return false;\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t\n\t    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\t\n\t    function Repeat(value, times) {\n\t      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n\t        return new Repeat(value, times);\n\t      }\n\t      this._value = value;\n\t      this.size = times === undefined ?

the\n\t// purpose of driving physical animations.\n\t//\n\t// Origin\n\t// ------\n\t// [Rebound](http://facebook.github.io/rebound) was originally written\n\t// in Java to provide a lightweight physics system for\n\t// [Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.home) and\n\t// [Chat Heads](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca)\n\t// on Android. It's now been adopted by several other Android\n\t// applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\n\t// way to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a\n\t// [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kNm-DgyjY). Since then\n\t// the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\n\t// Check out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an\n\t// example.\n\t//\n\t// Overview\n\t// --------\n\t// The Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring\n\t// objects and iterating those Springs through a physics solver loop\n\t// until equilibrium is achieved. The Spring class is the basic\n\t// animation driver provided by Rebound. By attaching a listener to\n\t// a Spring, you can observe its motion. The observer function is\n\t// notified of position changes on the spring as it solves for\n\t// equilibrium. These position updates can be mapped to an animation\n\t// range to drive animated property updates on your user interface\n\t// elements (translation, rotation, scale, etc).\n\t//\n\t// Example\n\t// -------\n\t// Here's a simple example. Pressing and releasing on the logo below\n\t// will cause it to scale up and down with a springy animation.\n\t//\n\t// <div style=\"text-align:center; margin-bottom:50px; margin-top:50px\">\n\t//   <img\n\t//     src=\"http://facebook.github.io/rebound/images/rebound.png\"\n\t//     id=\"logo\"\n\t//   />\n\t// </div>\n\t// <script src=\"../rebound.min.js\"></script>\n\t// <script>\n\t//\n\t// function scale(el, val) {\n\t//   el.style.mozTransform =\n\t//   el.style.msTransform =\n\t//   el.style.webkitTransform =\n\t//   el.style.transform = 'scale3d(' + val + ', ' + val + ', 1)';\n\t// }\n\t// var el = document.getElementById('logo');\n\t//\n\t// var springSystem = new rebound.SpringSystem();\n\t// var spring = springSystem.createSpring(50, 3);\n\t// spring.addListener({\n\t//   onSpringUpdate: function(spring) {\n\t//     var val = spring.getCurrentValue();\n\t//     val = rebound.MathUtil.mapValueInRange(val, 0, 1, 1, 0.5);\n\t//     scale(el, val);\n\t//   }\n\t// });\n\t//\n\t// el.addEventListener('mousedown', function() {\n\t//   spring.setEndValue(1);\n\t// });\n\t//\n\t// el.addEventListener('mouseout', function() {\n\t//   spring.setEndValue(0);\n\t// });\n\t//\n\t// el.addEventListener('mouseup', function() {\n\t//   spring.setEndValue(0);\n\t// });\n\t//\n\t// </script>\n\t//\n\t// Here's how it works.\n\t//\n\t// ```\n\t// // Get a reference to the logo element.\n\t// var el = document.getElementById('logo');\n\t//\n\t// // create a SpringSystem and a Spring with a bouncy config.\n\t// var springSystem = new rebound.SpringSystem();\n\t// var spring = springSystem.createSpring(50, 3);\n\t//\n\t// // Add a listener to the spring.

* Animations are an important part of modern UX, and the `Animated`\n * library is designed to make them fluid, powerful, and easy to build and\n * maintain.\n *\n * The simplest workflow is to create an `Animated.Value`, hook it up to one or\n * more style attributes of an animated component, and then drive updates either\n * via animations, such as `Animated.timing`, or by hooking into gestures like\n * panning or scrolling via `Animated.event`.  `Animated.Value` can also bind to\n * props other than style, and can be interpolated as well.  Here is a basic\n * example of a container view that will fade in when it's mounted:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  class FadeInView extends React.Component {\n *    constructor(props) {\n *      super(props);\n *      this.state = {\n *        fadeAnim: new Animated.Value(0), // init opacity 0\n *      };\n *    }\n *    componentDidMount() {\n *      Animated.timing(          // Uses easing functions\n *        this.state.fadeAnim,    // The value to drive\n *        {toValue: 1},           // Configuration\n *      ).start();                // Don't forget start!\n *    }\n *    render() {\n *      return (\n *        <Animated.View          // Special animatable View\n *          style={{opacity: this.state.fadeAnim}}> // Binds\n *          {this.props.children}\n *        </Animated.View>\n *      );\n *    }\n *  }\n *```\n *\n * Note that only animatable components can be animated.  `View`, `Text`, and\n * `Image` are already provided, and you can create custom ones with\n * `createAnimatedComponent`.  These special components do the magic of binding\n * the animated values to the properties, and do targeted native updates to\n * avoid the cost of the react render and reconciliation process on every frame.\n * They also handle cleanup on unmount so they are safe by default.\n *\n * Animations are heavily configurable.  Custom and pre-defined easing\n * functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can\n * all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.\n *\n * A single `Animated.Value` can drive any number of properties, and each\n * property can be run through an interpolation first.  An interpolation maps\n * input ranges to output ranges, typically using a linear interpolation but\n * also supports easing functions.  By default, it will extrapolate the curve\n * beyond the ranges given, but you can also have it clamp the output value.\n *\n * For example, you may want to think about your `Animated.Value` as going from\n * 0 to 1, but animate the position from 150px to 0px and the opacity from 0 to\n * 1. This can easily be done by modifying `style` in the example above like so:\n *\n *```javascript\n *  style={{\n *    opacity: this.state.fadeAnim, // Binds directly\n *    transform: [{\n *      translateY: this.state.fadeAnim.interpolate({\n *        inputRange: [0, 1],\n *        outputRange: [150, 0]  // 0 : 150, 0.5 : 75, 1 : 0\n *      }),\n *    }],\n *  }}>\n *```\n *\n * Animations can also be combined in complex ways using composition functions\n * such as `sequence` and `parallel`, and can also be chained together simply\n * by setting the `toValue` of one animation to be another `Animated.Value`.\n *\n * `Animated.ValueXY` is handy for 2D animations, like panning, and there are\n * other helpful additions like `setOffset` and `getLayout` to aid with typical\n * interaction patterns, like drag-and-drop.\n *\n * You can see more example usage in `AnimationExample.js`, the Gratuitous\n * Animation App, and [Animations documentation guide](docs/animations.html).\n *\n * Note that `Animated` is designed to be fully serializable so that animations\n * can be run in a high performance way, independent of the normal JavaScript\n * event loop. This does influence the API, so keep that in mind when it seems a\n * little trickier to do something compared to a fully synchronous system.\n * Checkout `Animated.Value.addListener` as a way to work around some of these\n * limitations, but use it sparingly since it might have performance\n * implications in the future.\n */\nmodule.exports={\n/**\n   * Standard value class for driving animations.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the elemement, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node who's\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <div\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <div>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </div>\n *     </div>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\nvar States = keyMirror({\n  NOT_RESPONDER: null, // Not the responder\n

Events\":\n *\n * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n *   `extractEvents()`.\n * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n *   dispatched events\".\n * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginHub` (hence the\n *   name deferred).\n *\n * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginHub`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginHub` dispatches as usual)\n */\n\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === 'topSelectionChange' ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder;\n\n  // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : EventPluginUtils.getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst);\n\n  // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

A `ListViewDataSource` is created with functions for\n * extracting data from the input blob, and comparing elements (with default\n * implementations for convenience).  The input blob can be as simple as an\n * array of strings, or an object with rows nested inside section objects.\n *\n * To update the data in the datasource, use `cloneWithRows` (or\n * `cloneWithRowsAndSections` if you care about sections).  The data in the\n * data source is immutable, so you can't modify it directly.  The clone methods\n * suck in the new data and compute a diff for each row so ListView knows\n * whether to re-render it or not.\n *\n * In this example, a component receives data in chunks, handled by\n * `_onDataArrived`, which concats the new data onto the old data and updates the\n * data source.  We use `concat` to create a new array - mutating `this._data`,\n * e.g. with `this._data.push(newRowData)`, would be an error. `_rowHasChanged`\n * understands the shape of the row data and knows how to efficiently compare\n * it.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   var ds = new ListViewDataSource({rowHasChanged: this._rowHasChanged});\n *   return {ds};\n * },\n * _onDataArrived(newData) {\n *   this._data = this._data.concat(newData);\n *   this.setState({\n *     ds: this.state.ds.cloneWithRows(this._data)\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n */\n\nclass ListViewDataSource {\n\n  /**\n   * You can provide custom extraction and `hasChanged` functions for section\n   * headers and rows.

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling. The `ScrollResponder` is a natural place\n * to put this logic since it can support not dismissing the keyboard while\n * scrolling, unless a recognized \"tap\"-like gesture has occurred.\n *\n * The public lifecycle API includes events for keyboard interaction, responder\n * interaction, and scrolling (among others). The keyboard callbacks\n * `onKeyboardWill/Did/*` are *global* events, but are invoked on scroll\n * responder's props so that you can guarantee that the scroll responder's\n * internal state has been updated accordingly (and deterministically) by\n * the time the props callbacks are invoke. Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\n   *\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\n   *\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\n   *\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\n   *\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\n   *\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\n   *\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\n   *\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\n   *     }\n   *\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\n   *\n   */\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n      return false;\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\n        return true;\n      }\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\n    if (a === b) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    if (\n      !isIterable(b) ||\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\n    ) {\n      return false;\n    }\n\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\n      return true;\n    }\n\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\n\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\n      var entries = a.entries();\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\n      }) && entries.next().done;\n    }\n\n    var flipped = false;\n\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\n          a.cacheResult();\n        }\n      } else {\n        flipped = true;\n        var _ = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = _;\n      }\n    }\n\n    var allEqual = true;\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\n        allEqual = false;\n        return false;\n      }\n    });\n\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\n  }\n\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\n\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\n      }\n      this._value = value;\n      this.size = times === undefined ?

It's now been adopted by several other Android\n// applications. This JavaScript port was written to provide a quick\n// way to demonstrate Rebound animations on the web for a\n// [conference talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kNm-DgyjY). Since then\n// the JavaScript version has been used to build some really nice interfaces.\n// Check out [brandonwalkin.com](http://brandonwalkin.com) for an\n// example.\n//\n// Overview\n// --------\n// The Library provides a SpringSystem for maintaining a set of Spring\n// objects and iterating those Springs through a physics solver loop\n// until equilibrium is achieved. The Spring class is the basic\n// animation driver provided by Rebound. By attaching a listener to\n// a Spring, you can observe its motion.

However, `currentState` will be null at launch\n * while `AppState` retrieves it over the bridge.\n *\n * ```\n * getInitialState: function() {\n *   return {\n *     currentAppState: AppState.currentState,\n *   };\n * },\n * componentDidMount: function() {\n *   AppState.addEventListener('change', this._handleAppStateChange);\n * },\n * componentWillUnmount: function() {\n *   AppState.removeEventListener('change', this._handleAppStateChange);\n * },\n * _handleAppStateChange: function(currentAppState) {\n *   this.setState({ currentAppState, });\n * },\n * render: function() {\n *   return (\n *     <Text>Current state is: {this.state.currentAppState}</Text>\n *   );\n * },\n * ```\n *\n * This example will only ever appear to say \"Current state is: active\" because\n * the app is only visible to the user when in the `active` state, and the null\n * state will happen only momentarily.\n */\n\nclass AppState {\n  _handlers: Object;\n  currentState: ?string;\n\n  constructor() {\n    this.currentState = 'active';\n    this._handlers = {\n      change: [],\n      memoryWarning: []\n    };\n\n    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API\n    var hidden, visibilityChange;\n    if (typeof document.hidden !== 'undefined') { // Opera 12.10 and Firefox 18 and later support\n      hidden = 'hidden';\n      visibilityChange = 'visibilitychange';\n    } else if (typeof document.msHidden !== 'undefined') {\n      hidden = 'msHidden';\n      visibilityChange = 'msvisibilitychange';\n    } else if (typeof document.webkitHidden !== 'undefined') {\n      hidden = 'webkitHidden';\n      visibilityChange = 'webkitvisibilitychange';\n    }\n\n    document.addEventListener(visibilityChange, () => {\n      this.currentState = document[hidden] ?
